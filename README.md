Survive by any means necessary... 

The town is under attack and you need to get right out of there. 
Use your power of clearing the way to stay alive long enough to escape. 

Created with Unity, Inkscape, Paint.net, Sunvox, and Bfxr. Big thanks to those that made these awesome tools! 

This has been my biggest project yet, and there was a lot that I didn't have time to do.
Biggest of which is a restart feature...that was the next item in the pipeline.

But in terms of code, I started off with the intention of writing good, scalable code, but as time progressed and the pressure increased, I found myself writing worse and worse code. 
I'm not proud about that and I intend to go back to refactor everything I've written to a better level...one day.
